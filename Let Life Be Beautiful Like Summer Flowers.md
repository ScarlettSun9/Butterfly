# Let Life Be Beautiful Like Summer Flowers

by Rabindranath Tagore
> 
> Life, thin and light-off time and time again
> Frivolous tireless
> 
> 1.
> I heard the echo, from the valleys and the heart
> 
> Open to the lonely soul of sickle harvesting
> 
> Repeat outrightly, but also repeat the well-being of
> 
> Eventually swaying in the deseart oasis
> 
> I believe I am
> 
> Born as the bright summer flowers
> 
> Do not withered undefeated fiery demon rule
> 
> Heart rate and breathing to bear the load of the cumbersome
> 
> Bored
> 
> 2.
> I heard the music, from the moon and carcass
> 
> Auxiliary extreme aestheticism bait to capture misty
> 
> Filling the intense life, but also filling the pure
> 
> There are always memories throughout the earth
> 
> I believe I am
> 
> Died as the quiet beauty of autumn leaves
> 
> Sheng is not chaos, smoke gesture
> 
> Even wilt also retained bone proudly Qing Feng muscle
> 
> Occult
> 
> 3. 
> I hear love, I believe in love
> 
> Love is a pool of struggling blue-green algae
> 
> As desolate micro-burst of wind
>
> Bleeding through my veins
> 
> Years stationed in the belief
> 
> 4.
> I believe that all can hear
> 
> Even anticipate discrete, I met the other their own
> 
> Some can not grasp the moment
> 
> Left to the East to go West, the dead must not return to nowhere
> 
> See, I wear Zan Flowers on my head, in full bloom along the way all the way
> 
> Frequently missed some, but also deeply moved by wind, frost, snow or rain
